# React + Vite

**NOTE: You will need to add in the URL for the server which can be found on Canvas into the .env file
**Environmental variables must start with *VITE_* to be accessed using *"import.meta.env.VITE_XXXXXXXXXX"*

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
